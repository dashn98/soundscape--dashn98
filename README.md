Soundscape Proposal:  
For my soundscape project I want to make my story about a tap dancer. I would like the story to lapse over a long period of time by first having some repetitive sounds of driving to a tap practice, a teacher saying “5,6,7,8”, the sounds of tap dancing and some mistakes in the tap sounds, possibly some music in the background and the murmur between dancers after class. I then would like it to transition to the night of the show, the sounds would include the sounds of dancers talking in the dressing room, the sounds of hairspray and deep breaths. The end would include the sound of the lights clicking on, the music starting, louder this time so you know it is the performance, and a portion of a tap dance and end in cheers from the audience, cameras clicking and a sigh of relief from the dancer as she leaves the stage.
