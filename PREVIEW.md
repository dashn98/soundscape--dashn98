Hi Everyone!  
Here is my Soundscape preview my project is about a tap dancer and her routine throughout practice leading up to the night  
of the big show. Right now, it is very rough, I started with a car starting and then added driving and music playing along   
to represent the dancer’s drive to tap practice and then a car door shut once she arrives. I then left some spaces where I   
still need to obtain sounds such as people chattering in the background before the dancing starts. I am wondering if anyone  
has ideas on where would be best to obtain a natural sounding recording or help me re-enact the sound of chatter in a hallway.   
I also would like to create some better clearer tap sounds. I will likely re-record these sounds and possibly make up some   
short choreography for the later portion of tapping that I am hoping to add in the end to represent the final performance.   
I am also looking for some people whose voices I could record for a few portions of my soundscape, I would like to add some   
sounds of an instructor in class saying “5,6,7,8” or possibly counting through the tap routine. In my preview I started to   
overlay some sounds and piece it together but I am still playing around with the volume and the places the sounds should   
overlay. I also would like to find a sound to play in the background with the tapping. I played around with this but ended  
up deleting the track I found as it didn’t match up with the beats of the tapping. This is an added challenge because this  
soundscape includes dancing, especially a type of dancing which creates sounds. I realized I am going to have to think about  
musicality when overlaying music and tap recordings in my piece.
