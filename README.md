# soundscape--dashn98
Hi I'm Nicole and this is my soundscape project for Composing Digital Media!  

For my soundscape I decided to use the sounds that a dancer might hear as she leaves for a big performance, enters the building, performs and leaves the performance. This soundscape includes sounds from original recordings by me as well as those licensed under creative commons. This piece is edited in audacity and my progress can be tracked in this GitHub repository. The concept changed a lot throughout my progress as I first thought I wanted the piece to span multiple days and include both rehearsal for a dancer and a performance. I then decided to focus just on the final performance as the storyline was a bit more concise and so I could focus more thought on the sounds and words you would hear during a dance recital. My piece also shifted as I decided to represent two dances in the performance instead of my original thought of only using the sounds of a tap dancer. I felt that this change created more diversity throughout my piece and made it more exciting. As you listen you will hear the drive to the theatre, the chatter as the dancer begins to get ready, the two performances interrupted by applause, the final applause and the chatter that leads to the drive home in the same way it began. This piece was very much inspired by my own experiences as a dancer. The nervous deep breaths before a show, the sigh of relief when it is over and the cheers and exclamations from the audience afterward. This piece was challenging as it required some musicality between the dancing sounds and music. I hope that the listener feels the positive energy that this performance has and can envision the movements and the setting of the piece as the sounds occur
