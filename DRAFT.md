Hi Everyone,
For my first full draft I decided to modify my storyline slightly from my original proposal.  
In my proposal I was originally thinking I would have both a tap rehearsal and a performance.  
I decided to stick to just the performance. I think this storyline is a little clearer as it   
might confuse the listener to jump to different time periods so abruptly. My new storyline is   
driving to the theatre, the sounds of chatter in the audience as the dancer gets ready, the  
performance, the audience reaction and then finally driving home from the theatre. In this   
draft I added more sounds that were not in my original preview. I added a few more vocal parts   
that I recorded of friends wishing the dancer good luck and congratulating her afterward. I   
also re-recorded the tap section of my soundscape. I asked a group of dancers in Pitt dance   
ensemble during our rehearsal if I could record and I think the sounds are much better due to   
the echo of the room and much more interesting because we used part of the choreography from  
our dance. I also like the sound of multiple dancers rather than just one. One part I don’t   
particularly like is the clapping from the audience at the end. I couldn’t get the greatest   
recording of an audience so I may have to look for some sounds online or ask around the class  
if anyone has a recording of an audience clapping. I wanted my soundscape to end in a similar  
way that it started to get the whole timeline of arriving at the performance and leaving. To   
do this I repeated the car sounds and music playing at the beginning.  I am excited about how   
this is beginning to unfold! My next goal is to add the mystery sound.
